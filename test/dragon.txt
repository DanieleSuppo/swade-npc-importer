W Dragon
Dragons are fire-breathing monsters that
bring doom and despair to the villages they
ravage. Such creatures should not be fought
lightly as they are more than a match for even
a party of experienced adventurers. These
beasts are quite intelligent as well, and use
all of their advantages when confronted by
would-be dragon-slayers.
