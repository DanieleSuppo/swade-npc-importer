Goblin
Goblins of myth and legend are far more sinister creatures than some games and fiction
portray. In the original tales, they were
terrifying creatures that stole into homes
in the middle of the night to steal and eat
unruly children. The statistics here work
for both dark “fairy tale” goblins as well as
those found alongside orcs in contemporary
roleplaying games.
